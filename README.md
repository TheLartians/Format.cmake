# Format.cmake

clang-format and cmake-format for CMake

## About

Format.cmake adds six additional targets to your CMake project.

- `format` Shows which files are affected by clang-format
- `check-format` Errors if files are affected by clang-format (for CI integration)
- `fix-format` Applies clang-format to all affected files

For cmake-format, just prepend `cmake-` to `format`, like `fix-cmake-format`.

To run the targets, invoke CMake with `cmake --build <build directory> --target <target name>`.
